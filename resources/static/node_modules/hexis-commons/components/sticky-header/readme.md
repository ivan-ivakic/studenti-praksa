# Hexis Sticky Header

Hexis script for a "sticky" header.


## Requirements

- [Hexis Script Core](https://github.com/Internet-Inovacije/hexis-commons/tree/master/scripts/core)


## How to use

1. Include the script file in your main.js concatenation.

2. Include the scss file somewhere in your stylesheets.

3. Attach the ```data-stickyHeader``` attribute to the desired HTML element. Script will auto-activate.

4. A ```data-stuck="true|false"``` attribute will be automatically added, which you can then hook into to modify the design and behaviour. Optionally, you may add ```data-stuck="false"``` by default for design stability.


## HTML Options

Additional options can be passed using the ```data``` attributes again.

- ```data-autohide``` will modify the behaviour so that the sticky header autohides while the user is scrolling down. It reveals itself only when the user scrolls upwards.


## Sass Variables

You can overwrite some of the default variables in your stylesheets. Simply define these variables before you include the scss file in order to overwrite them.

- ```$hexis-stickyHeader-transitionDuration``` (default: 600ms) contains the transition duration time for showing the stickyHeader


## Browser support

Not fully tested at the moment. It should work with any browser supporting css transforms and transitions, which is roughly everything + IE10, but not Opera Mini
