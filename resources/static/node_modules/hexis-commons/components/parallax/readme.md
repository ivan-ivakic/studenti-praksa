# Hexis Parallax

Parallax script and style used in Hexis projects.

It's lighweight, and most importantly - performance oriented. It uses CSS transforms, transitions, deferred scrolling and requestAnimationFrame. It can easily achieve 60fps on most laptop devices. Only downside is that the reaction time is delayed, so it cannot be used for instant scroll feedback/response.

There are no styles other than a simple css transition. There is also no html/css structure on which this scripts depends upon. Parallax script only translates your target vertically while you scroll. Everything else, including the size, design, layering, and positioning, is your choice.


## Requirements

- [Hexis Script Core](https://github.com/Internet-Inovacije/hexis-commons/tree/master/scripts/core)

- "transforms" and "transitions" classes on the html element (will not activate without it).


## How to use

1. Include the desired script version in your script concatenation.

2. Attach the parallax attribute to any element in the html, and the script will auto-activate.

```html
<div data-parallax="up"></div>
```


## HTML Options

Additional options can be passed using the ```data``` attributes again.

- ```data-parallaxSpeed``` {Integer} (required) is an arbitrary value determening the rate at which the element moves according to user's scroll. This includes both distance and speed. Higher value = element moves faster and further.

- ```data-parallaxOffset``` {String} is a base offset (marginTop) to better position your element in the design (can be percentage, pixels, ems, whatever suits you best)

**Full example:**

```html
<div data-parallax="up" data-parallaxSpeed="8" data-parallaxOffset="-20%"></div>
```


## Browser support

Not fully tested at the moment. It should work with any browser supporting css transforms and transitions, which is roughly everything + IE10, but not Opera Mini
