  QUEUES

  ABOUT:
    In order to modularize and truly separate script components, we cannot mix calls
    and listeners all over the place. One component may need to listen to a different
    component's ajax success call, and so on. Plus, for performance reasons, it's
    better to execute once on e.g., a page resize, than to have 10 resize listeners
    and various calculations which may be CPU intensive.

    In order to solve this problem, we can store our functions in a queue, and then
    just execute the queue at specific time. This can be once on every resize tick,
    or perhaps on an ajax success/dom insert to trigger "equal-column" calc again.

  HOW TO USE:
    If you wish to add something to the e.g., resize queue, write:

    queue.onResize.push(function(){
      // Your code here...
    });

    This will add your function to the "globalResizeEvents" queue. Later, in some
    resize listener when you wish to execute trigger queue, write:

    queue.run("onResize");

    This will run every stored function in the queue. In the order they were added.

  TIP:
    You can also create custom queue names and give them whatever names you want. If
    you need to create a new queue for you component, feel free to do so. But try to
    use existing queues if possible, to keep the list shorter.

  WARNING:
    As of this date (24.04.2015.), the queues have just been made, and there is very
    little integration across the site. More integrations will be added over time.
    And if you can, please contribute towards this goal.
